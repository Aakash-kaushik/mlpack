\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Implementation of action of Continuous Mountain Car. 

In Continuous mountain car gain, the action represents the force to be applied. This value is bounded in range -\/1.\+0 to 1.\+0. Unlike the simple mountain car environment, where action space has a discrete value, continuous mountain car has continous action space value.
