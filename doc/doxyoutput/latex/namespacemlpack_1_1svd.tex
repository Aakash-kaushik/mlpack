\item 
class \textbf{ Bias\+SVD}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Bias SVD is an improvement on Regularized SVD which is a matrix factorization techniques. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \textbf{ Bias\+SVDFunction}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class contains methods which are used to calculate the cost of \doxyref{Bias\+SVD}{p.}{classmlpack_1_1svd_1_1BiasSVD}\textquotesingle{}s objective function, to calculate gradient of parameters with respect to the objective function, etc. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \textbf{ QUIC\+\_\+\+SVD}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em QUIC-\/\+SVD is a matrix factorization technique, which operates in a subspace such that A\textquotesingle{}s approximation in that subspace has minimum error(A being the data matrix). \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \textbf{ Randomized\+Block\+Krylov\+SVD}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Randomized block krylov SVD is a matrix factorization that is based on randomized matrix approximation techniques, developed in in \char`\"{}\+Randomized Block Krylov Methods for Stronger and Faster Approximate \+Singular Value Decomposition\char`\"{}. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \textbf{ Randomized\+SVD}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Randomized SVD is a matrix factorization that is based on randomized matrix approximation techniques, developed in in \char`\"{}\+Finding structure with randomness\+: \+Probabilistic algorithms for constructing approximate matrix decompositions\char`\"{}. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \textbf{ Regularized\+SVD}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Regularized SVD is a matrix factorization technique that seeks to reduce the error on the training set, that is on the examples for which the ratings have been provided by the users. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \textbf{ Regularized\+SVDFunction}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The data is stored in a matrix of type Mat\+Type, so that this class can be used with both dense and sparse matrix types. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \textbf{ SVDPlus\+Plus}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em SVD++ is a matrix decomposition tenique used in collaborative filtering. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
class \textbf{ SVDPlus\+Plus\+Function}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class contains methods which are used to calculate the cost of SVD++\textquotesingle{}s objective function, to calculate gradient of parameters with respect to the objective function, etc. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
