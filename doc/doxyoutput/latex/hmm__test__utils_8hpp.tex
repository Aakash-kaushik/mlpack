Structs for initializing and training HMMs (either of Discrete, Gaussian, GMM, or Diagonal GMM HMMs). These structs are passed as template parameters to the Perform\+Action function of an HMMModel object. These structs have been adapted from the structs in mlpack/methods/hmm/hmm\+\_\+train\+\_\+main.\+cpp.
