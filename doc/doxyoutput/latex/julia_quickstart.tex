\doxysection{Introduction}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_intro}
This page describes how you can quickly get started using mlpack from Julia and gives a few examples of usage, and pointers to deeper documentation.

This quickstart guide is also available for \doxyref{Python}{p.}{python_quickstart}, \doxyref{the command-\/line}{p.}{cli_quickstart}, \doxyref{Go}{p.}{go_quickstart} and \doxyref{R}{p.}{r_quickstart}.\doxysection{Installing mlpack}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_install}
Installing the mlpack bindings for Julia is straightforward; you can just use {\ttfamily Pkg\+:} 


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{using Pkg}
\DoxyCodeLine{Pkg.add("{}mlpack"{})}

\end{DoxyCode}


Building the Julia bindings from scratch is a little more in-\/depth, though. For information on that, follow the instructions on the \doxyref{Building mlpack From Source}{p.}{build} page, and be sure to specify {\ttfamily -\/DBUILD\+\_\+\+JULIA\+\_\+\+BINDINGS=ON} to CMake; you may need to also set the location of the Julia program with {\ttfamily -\/DJULIA\+\_\+\+EXECUTABLE=/path/to/julia}.\doxysection{Simple mlpack quickstart example}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_example}
As a really simple example of how to use mlpack from Julia, let\textquotesingle{}s do some simple classification on a subset of the standard machine learning {\ttfamily covertype} dataset. We\textquotesingle{}ll first split the dataset into a training set and a testing set, then we\textquotesingle{}ll train an mlpack random forest on the training data, and finally we\textquotesingle{}ll print the accuracy of the random forest on the test dataset.

You can copy-\/paste this code directly into Julia to run it. You may need to add some extra packages with, e.\+g., {\ttfamily using Pkg; Pkg.\+add(\char`\"{}\+CSV\char`\"{}); Pkg.\+add(\char`\"{}\+Data\+Frames\char`\"{}); Pkg.\+add(\char`\"{}\+Libz\char`\"{})}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{using CSV}
\DoxyCodeLine{using DataFrames}
\DoxyCodeLine{using Libz}
\DoxyCodeLine{using mlpack}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Load the dataset from an online URL.  Replace with 'covertype.csv.gz' if you}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# want to use on the full dataset.}
\DoxyCodeLine{df = CSV.read(ZlibInflateInputStream(open(download(}
\DoxyCodeLine{        "{}http://www.mlpack.org/datasets/covertype-\/small.csv.gz"{}))))}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Split the labels.}
\DoxyCodeLine{labels = df[!, :label][:]}
\DoxyCodeLine{dataset = select!(df, Not(:label))}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Split the dataset using mlpack.}
\DoxyCodeLine{test, test\_labels, train, train\_labels = mlpack.preprocess\_split(}
\DoxyCodeLine{    dataset,}
\DoxyCodeLine{    input\_labels=labels,}
\DoxyCodeLine{    test\_ratio=0.3)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Train a random forest.}
\DoxyCodeLine{rf\_model, \_, \_ = mlpack.random\_forest(training=train,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                              labels=train\_labels,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                              print\_training\_accuracy=true,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                              num\_trees=10,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                              minimum\_leaf\_size=3)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Predict the labels of the test points.}
\DoxyCodeLine{\_, predictions, \_ = mlpack.random\_forest(input\_model=rf\_model,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                                         test=test)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Now print the accuracy.  The third return value ('probabilities'), which we}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# ignored here, could also be used to generate an ROC curve.}
\DoxyCodeLine{correct = sum(predictions .== test\_labels)}
\DoxyCodeLine{print("{}\$(correct) out of \$(length(test\_labels)) test points correct "{} *}
\DoxyCodeLine{    "{}(\$(correct / length(test\_labels) * 100.0)\%).\(\backslash\)n"{})}

\end{DoxyCode}


We can see that we achieve reasonably good accuracy on the test dataset (80\%+); if we use the full {\ttfamily covertype.\+csv.\+gz}, the accuracy should increase significantly (but training will take longer).

It\textquotesingle{}s easy to modify the code above to do more complex things, or to use different mlpack learners, or to interface with other machine learning toolkits.\doxysection{What else does mlpack implement?}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_whatelse}
The example above has only shown a little bit of the functionality of mlpack. Lots of other commands are available with different functionality. A full list of each of these commands and full documentation can be found on the following page\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\texttt{ Julia documentation}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

You can also use the Julia REPL to explore the {\ttfamily mlpack} module and its functions; every function comes with comprehensive documentation.

For more information on what mlpack does, see {\texttt{ https\+://www.\+mlpack.\+org/}}. Next, let\textquotesingle{}s go through another example for providing movie recommendations with mlpack.\doxysection{Using mlpack for movie recommendations}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_movierecs}
In this example, we\textquotesingle{}ll train a collaborative filtering model using mlpack\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily {\texttt{ cf()}}} method. We\textquotesingle{}ll train this on the Movie\+Lens dataset from {\texttt{ https\+://grouplens.\+org/datasets/movielens/}}, and then we\textquotesingle{}ll use the model that we train to give recommendations.

You can copy-\/paste this code directly into Julia to run it.

\doxysection{Next steps with mlpack}\label{julia_quickstart_julia_quickstart_nextsteps}
Now that you have done some simple work with mlpack, you have seen how it can easily plug into a data science workflow in Julia. A great thing to do next would be to look at more documentation for the Julia mlpack bindings\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\texttt{ Julia mlpack binding documentation}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also, mlpack is much more flexible from C++ and allows much greater functionality. So, more complicated tasks are possible if you are willing to write C++ (or perhaps Cxx\+Wrap.\+jl). To get started learning about mlpack in C++, the following resources might be helpful\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\texttt{ mlpack C++ tutorials}}
\item {\texttt{ mlpack build and installation guide}}
\item {\texttt{ Simple sample C++ mlpack programs}}
\item {\texttt{ mlpack Doxygen documentation homepage}}
