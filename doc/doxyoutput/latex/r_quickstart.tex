\doxysection{Introduction}\label{r_quickstart_r_quickstart_intro}
This page describes how you can quickly get started using mlpack from R and gives a few examples of usage, and pointers to deeper documentation.

This quickstart guide is also available for \doxyref{Python}{p.}{python_quickstart}, \doxyref{the command-\/line}{p.}{cli_quickstart}, \doxyref{Julia}{p.}{julia_quickstart} and \doxyref{Go}{p.}{go_quickstart}.\doxysection{Installing mlpack binary package}\label{r_quickstart_r_quickstart_install}
Installing the mlpack bindings for R is straightforward; you can just use CRAN\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{install.packages('mlpack')}

\end{DoxyCode}
\doxysection{Installing mlpack package from source}\label{r_quickstart_r_quickstart_source_install}
Building the R bindings from scratch is a little more in-\/depth, though. For information on that, follow the instructions on the \doxyref{Building mlpack From Source}{p.}{build} page, and be sure to specify {\ttfamily -\/DBUILD\+\_\+\+R\+\_\+\+BINDINGS=ON} to CMake; you may need to also set the location of the R program with {\ttfamily -\/DR\+\_\+\+EXECUTABLE=/path/to/R}.\doxysection{Simple mlpack quickstart example}\label{r_quickstart_r_quickstart_example}
As a really simple example of how to use mlpack from R, let\textquotesingle{}s do some simple classification on a subset of the standard machine learning {\ttfamily covertype} dataset. We\textquotesingle{}ll first split the dataset into a training set and a testing set, then we\textquotesingle{}ll train an mlpack random forest on the training data, and finally we\textquotesingle{}ll print the accuracy of the random forest on the test dataset.

You can copy-\/paste this code directly into R to run it.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{if(!requireNamespace("{}data.table"{}, quietly = TRUE)) \{ install.packages("{}data.table"{}) \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{suppressMessages(\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    library("{}mlpack"{})}
\DoxyCodeLine{    library("{}data.table"{})}
\DoxyCodeLine{\})}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Load the dataset from an online URL.  Replace with 'covertype.csv.gz' if you}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# want to use on the full dataset.}
\DoxyCodeLine{df <-\/ fread("{}https://www.mlpack.org/datasets/covertype-\/small.csv.gz"{})}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Split the labels.}
\DoxyCodeLine{labels <-\/ df[, .(label)]}
\DoxyCodeLine{dataset <-\/ df[, label:=NULL]}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Split the dataset using mlpack.}
\DoxyCodeLine{prepdata <-\/ preprocess\_split(input = dataset,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             input\_labels = labels,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             test\_ratio = 0.3,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                             verbose = TRUE)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Train a random forest.}
\DoxyCodeLine{output <-\/ random\_forest(training = prepdata\$training,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                        labels = prepdata\$training\_labels,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                        print\_training\_accuracy = TRUE,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                        num\_trees = 10,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                        minimum\_leaf\_size = 3,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                        verbose = TRUE)}
\DoxyCodeLine{rf\_model <-\/ output\$output\_model}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Predict the labels of the test points.}
\DoxyCodeLine{output <-\/ random\_forest(input\_model = rf\_model,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                        test = prepdata\$test,}
\DoxyCodeLine{                        verbose = TRUE)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Now print the accuracy.  The third return value ('probabilities'), which we}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# ignored here, could also be used to generate an ROC curve.}
\DoxyCodeLine{correct <-\/ sum(output\$predictions == prepdata\$test\_labels)}
\DoxyCodeLine{cat(correct, "{}out of"{}, length(prepdata\$test\_labels), "{}test points correct"{},}
\DoxyCodeLine{    correct / length(prepdata\$test\_labels) * 100.0, "{}\%\(\backslash\)n"{})}

\end{DoxyCode}


We can see that we achieve reasonably good accuracy on the test dataset (80\%+); if we use the full {\ttfamily covertype.\+csv.\+gz}, the accuracy should increase significantly (but training will take longer).

It\textquotesingle{}s easy to modify the code above to do more complex things, or to use different mlpack learners, or to interface with other machine learning toolkits.\doxysection{What else does mlpack implement?}\label{r_quickstart_r_quickstart_whatelse}
The example above has only shown a little bit of the functionality of mlpack. Lots of other commands are available with different functionality. A full list of each of these commands and full documentation can be found on the following page\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\texttt{ r documentation}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

For more information on what mlpack does, see {\texttt{ https\+://www.\+mlpack.\+org/}}. Next, let\textquotesingle{}s go through another example for providing movie recommendations with mlpack.\doxysection{Using mlpack for movie recommendations}\label{r_quickstart_r_quickstart_movierecs}
In this example, we\textquotesingle{}ll train a collaborative filtering model using mlpack\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily {\texttt{ cf()}}} method. We\textquotesingle{}ll train this on the Movie\+Lens dataset from {\texttt{ https\+://grouplens.\+org/datasets/movielens/}}, and then we\textquotesingle{}ll use the model that we train to give recommendations.

You can copy-\/paste this code directly into R to run it.

\DoxyCodeLine{             verbose = TRUE,}

\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Now query the 5 top movies for user 1.}
\DoxyCodeLine{output <-\/ cf(input\_model = cf\_model,}
\DoxyCodeLine{             query = matrix(1),}
\DoxyCodeLine{             recommendations = 10,}
\DoxyCodeLine{             verbose = TRUE)}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Get the names of the movies for user 1.}
\DoxyCodeLine{cat("{}Recommendations for user 1:\(\backslash\)n"{})}
\DoxyCodeLine{for (i in 1:10) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{  cat("{}  "{}, i, "{}:"{}, as.character(movies[output\$output[i], 3]), "{}\(\backslash\)n"{})}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


Here is some example output, showing that user 1 seems to have good taste in movies\+:

\doxysection{Next steps with mlpack}\label{r_quickstart_r_quickstart_nextsteps}
After working through this overview to {\ttfamily mlpack}\textquotesingle{}s R package, we hope you are inspired to use {\ttfamily mlpack}\textquotesingle{} in your data science workflow. We recommend as part of your next steps to look at more documentation for the R mlpack bindings\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\texttt{ R mlpack binding documentation}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also, mlpack is much more flexible from C++ and allows much greater functionality. So, more complicated tasks are possible if you are willing to write C++ (or perhaps Rcpp). To get started learning about mlpack in C++, the following resources might be helpful\+:
