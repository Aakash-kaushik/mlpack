An implementation of Maximum Variance Unfolding. This file defines an MVU class as well as a class representing the objective function (a semidefinite program) which MVU seeks to minimize. Minimization is performed by the Augmented Lagrangian optimizer (which in turn uses the L-\/\+BFGS optimizer).

Note\+: this implementation of MVU does not work. See \#189.
