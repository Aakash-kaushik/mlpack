\doxysection{Introduction}\label{cli_quickstart_cli_quickstart_intro}
This page describes how you can quickly get started using mlpack from the command-\/line and gives a few examples of usage, and pointers to deeper documentation.

This quickstart guide is also available for \doxyref{Python}{p.}{python_quickstart}, \doxyref{R}{p.}{r_quickstart}, \doxyref{Julia}{p.}{julia_quickstart} and \doxyref{Go}{p.}{go_quickstart}.\doxysection{Installing mlpack}\label{cli_quickstart_cli_quickstart_install}
Installing the mlpack is straightforward and can be done with your system\textquotesingle{}s package manager.

For instance, for Ubuntu or Debian the command is simply


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install mlpack-\/bin}

\end{DoxyCode}


On Fedora or Red Hat\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo dnf install mlpack}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you use a different distribution, mlpack may be packaged under a different name. And if it is not packaged, you can use a Docker image from Dockerhub\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{docker run -\/it mlpack/mlpack /bin/bash}

\end{DoxyCode}


This Docker image has mlpack already built and installed.

If you prefer to build mlpack from scratch, see \doxyref{Building mlpack From Source}{p.}{build}.\doxysection{Simple mlpack quickstart example}\label{cli_quickstart_cli_quickstart_example}
As a really simple example of how to use mlpack from the command-\/line, let\textquotesingle{}s do some simple classification on a subset of the standard machine learning {\ttfamily covertype} dataset. We\textquotesingle{}ll first split the dataset into a training set and a testing set, then we\textquotesingle{}ll train an mlpack random forest on the training data, and finally we\textquotesingle{}ll print the accuracy of the random forest on the test dataset.

You can copy-\/paste this code directly into your shell to run it.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Get the dataset and unpack it.}
\DoxyCodeLine{wget https://www.mlpack.org/datasets/covertype-\/small.data.csv.gz}
\DoxyCodeLine{wget https://www.mlpack.org/datasets/covertype-\/small.labels.csv.gz}
\DoxyCodeLine{gunzip covertype-\/small.data.csv.gz covertype-\/small.labels.csv.gz}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Split the dataset; 70\% into a training set and 30\% into a test set.}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Each of these options has a shorthand single-\/character option but here we type}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# it all out for clarity.}
\DoxyCodeLine{mlpack\_preprocess\_split                                       \(\backslash\)}

\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/test\_ratio 0.3                                          \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/verbose}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Train a random forest.}
\DoxyCodeLine{mlpack\_random\_forest                                  \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/training\_file covertype-\/small.train.csv         \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/labels\_file covertype-\/small.train.labels.csv    \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/num\_trees 10                                    \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/minimum\_leaf\_size 3                             \(\backslash\)}

\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/verbose}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Now predict the labels of the test points and print the accuracy.}
\DoxyCodeLine{\# Also, save the test set predictions to the file 'predictions.csv'.}
\DoxyCodeLine{mlpack\_random\_forest                                    \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/input\_model\_file rf-\/model.bin                     \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/test\_file covertype-\/small.test.csv                \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/test\_labels\_file covertype-\/small.test.labels.csv  \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/predictions\_file predictions.csv                  \(\backslash\)}
\DoxyCodeLine{    -\/-\/verbose}

\end{DoxyCode}


We can see by looking at the output that we achieve reasonably good accuracy on the test dataset (80\%+). The file {\ttfamily predictions.\+csv} could also be used by other tools; for instance, we can easily calculate the number of points that were predicted incorrectly\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$ diff -\/U 0 predictions.csv covertype-\/small.test.labels.csv | grep '\string^@@' | wc -\/l}

\end{DoxyCode}


It\textquotesingle{}s easy to modify the code above to do more complex things, or to use different mlpack learners, or to interface with other machine learning toolkits.\doxysection{What else does mlpack implement?}\label{cli_quickstart_cli_quickstart_whatelse}
The example above has only shown a little bit of the functionality of mlpack. Lots of other commands are available with different functionality. A full list of commands and full documentation for each can be found on the following page\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\texttt{ CLI documentation}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

For more information on what mlpack does, see {\texttt{ https\+://www.\+mlpack.\+org/}}. Next, let\textquotesingle{}s go through another example for providing movie recommendations with mlpack.\doxysection{Using mlpack for movie recommendations}\label{cli_quickstart_cli_quickstart_movierecs}
In this example, we\textquotesingle{}ll train a collaborative filtering model using mlpack\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily mlpack\+\_\+cf} program. We\textquotesingle{}ll train this on the Movie\+Lens dataset from {\texttt{ https\+://grouplens.\+org/datasets/movielens/}}, and then we\textquotesingle{}ll use the model that we train to give recommendations.

You can copy-\/paste this code directly into the command line to run it.

\doxysection{Next steps with mlpack}\label{cli_quickstart_cli_quickstart_nextsteps}
Now that you have done some simple work with mlpack, you have seen how it can easily plug into a data science production workflow for the command line. A great thing to do next would be to look at more documentation for the mlpack command-\/line programs\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\texttt{ mlpack command-\/line program documentation}}
\end{DoxyItemize}

Also, mlpack is much more flexible from C++ and allows much greater functionality. So, more complicated tasks are possible if you are willing to write C++. To get started learning about mlpack in C++, the following resources might be helpful\+:

\item {\texttt{ mlpack C++ tutorials}}
\item {\texttt{ mlpack build and installation guide}}
\item {\texttt{ Simple sample C++ mlpack programs}}
