Using the contents of arma\+\_\+config.\+hpp, try to catch the condition where the user has included mlpack with ARMA\+\_\+64\+BIT\+\_\+\+WORD enabled but mlpack was compiled without ARMA\+\_\+64\+BIT\+\_\+\+WORD enabled. This should help prevent a long, drawn-\/out debugging process where nobody can figure out why the stack is getting mangled.
